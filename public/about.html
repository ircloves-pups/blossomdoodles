    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">About Us</h2>
    <p>At <strong>Blossom Doodles</strong>, we are dedicated to raising happy, healthy puppies — never in kennels or cages, but as part of our family.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">From the moment they are born, our puppies are raised inside our home where they are surrounded by the everyday sounds and rhythms of family life. They meet children, cats, and other dogs, ensuring they grow up well-socialised and confident.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">We are <em>not</em> a large-scale breeder or "puppy mill." We breed responsibly, with a focus on health, temperament, and welfare.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Before going to their new families, all of our puppies are <strong>veterinary-checked</strong>, <strong>microchipped</strong>, and <strong>vaccinated</strong>. We are always here to offer advice and support — even long after you’ve taken your new puppy home.</p>
